      "**Risk and Uncertainty Summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Client Feedback Delays (Medium Risk):** Delays in client feedback, particularly during Mockup Review & Approval (Task 2.3) and Client Review & Feedback (Task 5.6), can significantly impact the timeline. Proactive communication and setting clear expectations for feedback turnaround times are crucial mitigation strategies.\n",
      "*   **Content Creation Delays (Medium Risk):**  Task 2.4 (Content Creation) depends heavily on the client providing content. Delays in content delivery can push back subsequent phases.  Early and frequent communication with the client regarding content requirements and deadlines is essential.  Contingency time within Phase 2 already partially accounts for this.\n",
      "*   **Scope Creep (Low-Medium Risk):** While the project scope is defined, there's always a risk of scope creep, especially if client requirements evolve during the project.  Strict scope management, change request processes, and clear communication about project boundaries are important to mitigate this risk.\n",
      "*   **Technical Issues during Development (Low Risk):**  Unforeseen technical issues during front-end and back-end development (Phase 3 & 4) can occur, potentially leading to delays.  The team's expertise and allocated durations are designed to accommodate standard technical challenges.  However, complex or novel functionalities could introduce higher risk.\n",
      "*   **CMS Integration Complexity (Medium Risk - Conditional):** If CMS integration (Task 4.1) is required, its complexity can vary depending on the chosen CMS and specific client needs.  Thorough upfront planning and selection of a CMS familiar to the development team will reduce this risk. If no CMS is required, this risk is eliminated.\n",

      "\n",
      "Based on the estimations, the 11-week project timeline appears feasible. The durations allocated for each task are realistic considering the scope of a small business website development and the team's expertise. However, proactive risk management, particularly around client communication and content delivery, is essential to maintain the timeline and ensure successful project completion within budget.  Regular project monitoring against these estimations and timely adjustments as needed will be crucial for project success.\u001b[00m\n",
